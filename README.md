###GetBanked
This project was developed during the Capital One Software Engineering Summit (Aug 2021) as part of the hack-a-thon. 
The theme of the hack-a-thon was to come up with an idea that would help change banking for good.

During a speed round of brainstorming, we identified the need for active inclusion of communities without previous access or support from the financial industry. 
One of the main barriers to account ownership is lack of enough money (World Bank). 
One such community that has lower access is young adults: Both young adults with money who donâ€™t know about investing and 
young adults from lower-income backgrounds looking to gain financial power and literacy.

So, we set out to think about how might we create an intuitive and responsive tool to enable young adults to start their financial journey.
